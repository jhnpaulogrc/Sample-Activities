		<p><center><big><b>This project is broken down into 3 parts:</b></big></center></p>
		<p><b>Step 1:</b>You will find labels, make drawings, or take photos of the following:</p>
		<p>A product containing <b>type 1 binary ionic compound</b>(one metals that forms one type of action and one non-metal - <u>NO POLYATOMIC ION</u>)</p>
		<p>A product <del>contain</del> containing a <b>type 2 binary ionic compound </b>(one transition metal that you must specificy the charge that forms with one non-metal - <i>NO POLYATOMIC ION</i>)</p>
		<p>A product containing a <b>binary molecular compound</b> (only 2 elements, both of which are non-metals)</p>
		<p>A product containing <b>acid</b>(This will say "acid" in the ingredients list)</p>
		<p><big><mark>NOTE:</mark></big></p>
		<p>Your product may use slightly <u>different</u> naming rules. If you are unsure, check with me! Make sure you use the standard naming system that we have learned in class when you name the compound! </p>
