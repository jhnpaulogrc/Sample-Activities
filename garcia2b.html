		<center><h1><a name="top"></a>A COMPREHENSIVE BIOGRAPHY OF JOSE RIZAL</h1></center>
		<h6><center><a href="#bottom">Go to Bottom</a></center></h6>
		<p>Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda, more commonly known as Jose Rizal, was born on June 19, 1861 in the city of Kalamba, presently known as Calamba in Laguna. Rizal was the seventh among the eleven born to Francisco Engracio Rizal Mercado y Alejandro and Teodora Morales Alonzo Realonda y Quintos. Rizal had nine sisters, namely Saturnina being the eldest, followed by Narcisa, Olympia, Lucia, Maria, and Concepcion, who was born a year after Rizal, succeeded by Josefa, Trinidad, and Soledad, along with his only brother namely Paciano (Fleming, 2020). </p>
		<p>Jose Rizal described Francisco Mercado as an exemplary parent; he provided his children with a decent education. In addition, his father managed to afford to build a stone house by being frugal and saving deliberately; he also bought another one shortly other than the nipa cottage he constructed shaded by trees and bananas in the plot of their irrigated land. During nightfalls, his mother, Teodora, would gather all of them to say their prayers and would subsequently proceed to their Azotea, where they would enjoy the moonlight. On occasions, Rizal sometimes brings his supper to their Azotea to appreciate the beauty and bask in the glow of the moonlight. The Mercados had a nurse who would always tell them stories and was very fond of Rizal, threatening to abandon him to an imaginary being similar to what the Europeans deem as the 'bogeys' if he refused to eat (Craig, 2015). </p>
		<p>One night, the Mercados went to bed early except for Rizal and his mother Teodora; all the candles were already out, and the room dimly lit with the only source of light from the coconut oil. With the Spanish reader entitled "The Children's Friend," Teodora taught Rizal how to read that night. As the book was said to be an old copy and was quite rare, his sisters made a new cover since the original one was lost. There was something about that night that his mother became impatient with his poor reading considering he does not understand Spanish, so he was unable to read it with expression; she took the book from him and gave him a few scolding for drawing pictures on the pages before telling him to listen to how she reads. Like a child, Rizal listened to his mother enthusiastically as he was astonished by how the phrases sounded so pleasant that he stopped at every breath.</p>
		<p>Moreover, Rizal got bored listening to the sounds as he could not understand a single word said like any other child. Instead, he focused on the bright flame as tiny moths were playfully circling. His mother stopped reading when she noticed Rizal was no longer paying attention and told him she would read him a pretty story instead. Hearing the word "story" was like magic that it made Rizal open his eyes wide as he watched his mother search within the leaves of the book. He sat down, completely enthralled, as his mother proceeded to recite him the story of a young and elderly moth. Teodora translated the story in Tagalog a little at a time in order for him to understand it fully, and by doing so, increased Rizal's attention. As he was listening to the story, he fixed his gaze at the light of the flame and the moths circling it. After a few seconds, the flame and moth seemed to have distanced from him, and his mother's voice grew to sound strange; Rizal did not notice that the fable had already ended as he focused all of his attention on the fate of the moth. As his mother was tucking him in bed, she told him that he should not behave as the young moth in the fable did, as he might also get burnt if he became disobedient. Since Rizal was dozing off to sleep when his mother told him that, he could no longer recall if he replied, promised anything, cried, or did nothing at all; all the young boy could remember was that it happened moments before he finally fell asleep.</p>
		<p>It is undeniable that Rizal has a strong connection and bond with his family, which is why the death of his younger sister Concepcion, or as he referred to as 'Concha,' when he was four, affected him deeply, prompting him to cry for the first time out of affection and grief. In the same year, Rizal learned to write and furthered his education, seeing as his father was keen on looking after his education, even paying a former schoolmate to teach him the basics of Latin who also lived with them for five months until his death. Five years later, he started attending school in Biñan, where his father was born, wishing to continue learning Latin, which he knew little of. Rizal was sent to Biñan by his brother and reached the city during nightfall. He went to his aunt's house where he would be staying, and when the moon came up, his cousin gave him a tour around the city. Although Rizal viewed Biñan as a large and wealthy city, he could not consider it delightful or ebullient. Paciano, Rizal's older brother, departed and returned to Kalamba after introducing Rizal to Justiniano Aquino Cruz, his schoolmaster. Paciano insisted to Rizal that he should not use the surname 'Mercado' prior to enrollment as it was under the suspicion of the Spaniards at that time. According to Rizal's description, the schoolmaster was a tall and slender gentleman with a forward-leaning physique, elongated neck, and pointed nose. He didn't only speak Latin and Spanish fluently; he knew them by heart. Justiniano's classroom was within his house, just around thirty meters away from Rizal’s aunt's house. When he asked Rizal if he spoke or understood Latin and Spanish, he merely replied "a little," prompting Pedro, the schoolmaster's son, to mock him despite being the worst in the class (Guerrero, 1961). Due to the attitude shown by Pedro, Rizal challenged him to a brawl during the schoolmaster's siesta time, which Pedro gladly accepted as he was confident, he could beat Rizal, who was younger and shorter than him. Unfortunately, things didn't go as Pedro had hoped, as when they began to tussle, Rizal got a hold of him and hurled him over some of the benches, letting him go quickly to avoid hurting nothing but his pride. After feeling mortified by his loss, Pedro asked for a rematch, which Rizal refused as he was afraid of being punished by the schoolmaster who had just awoken. After he triumphed over Pedro, he became well-known among his classmates, and one of them, Andres Salandanan, challenged him to an arm-wrestling fight, in which Rizal lost. Just a few blocks from Justiniano's house, lives his father-in-law who goes by the name of Juancho, an elderly artist whom Rizal assisted with his paintings. Due to Rizal's interest in arts, particularly in painting, he, along with José Guevarra, his classmate, was referred to as the 'class painters.'</p>
		<p>Several months have passed, and he finally acquired a letter from Saturnina, his eldest sister, advising him that a steamer would be stopping for him on a specified day. On the afternoon of December 17, he left Biñan to return to Kalamba shortly after his cousin left remarks to the banquero regarding the speed. Rizal assumed he would be traveling without sharing a cabin with anyone, but Arturo Camps, a Frenchman and a friend of his father, looked after him throughout the trip. </p>
		<p>After days of his return to Kalamba, his parents agreed on making him stay there until he left for Manila shortly. At the same time as his arrival in Kalamba was his uncle Don Jose Alberto, who had just returned from Europe. The news of his wife leaving their home and abandoning their children in his absence greeted Don Alberto. After a futile search for his wife, Don Alberto brought her back and relocated to Biñan after the earnest request of Teodora, Jose Rizal's mother. A week has not passed, and Don Alberto's wife plotted a scheme with the Guardia Civil and accused her husband of poisoning her, with Teodora as an accomplice. Due to the accused's involvement, Teodora was sent to prison by their alcalde. Because the men who sent his mother to jail were often guests to their home and pretended to be their friends, Rizal distrusted friendship at a very young age. Shortly after his mother's imprisonment, he found out that his mother was ill for years, along with the discovery of the alcalde believing the accusation toward his mother from the beginning and that he had treated her poorly and brutally. </p>
		<p>Concurrently, Rizal's father planned to send him and his brother Paciano to Manila to take the secondary school admission tests at the Ateneo Municipal. Rizal and Paciano landed in Manila on June 10, 1872. Being tutored throughout his childhood, Rizal experienced tests for the first time in San Juan de Letran College, where his exams consisted of Christian theology, mathematics, and reading (Craig, 2015). After receiving a passing mark, he returned home with his brother. Rizal was taken to Father Magin Fernando as hoped, the Jesuit priest-in-charge of the Ateneo Municipal. Father Fernando was unwilling to admit Rizal in the beginning for the reason that he came in late, along with the fact that he didn't seem strong considering he was diminutive at the age of eleven compared to the others. As luck would have it, the nephew of the unfortunate Padre Burgos, Doctor Manuel Xerez Burgos, vouched for him, so he was admitted by Father Fernando.</p>
		<p>A small house near an Estero on Calle Carabello was where Rizal resided as he was studying in Manila. His class rankings went up by the end of the first week, and so he began to pay three pesos each month as he spent his siesta time at Santa Isabel College with Pastor Millena, a boy similar to his age, to climb the rank even higher. A month passed, and he was dubbed the 'Emperor,' and was pleased to win the first prize. Moreover, Rizal gained an additional prize for receiving an 'excellent' grade. Nevertheless, Rizal became dissatisfied with everything; after his schoolmaster had said, he only landed second place in all of his subjects by the end of the year. </p>
		<p>He returned to Kalamba to spend his vacation and went with his eldest sister Saturnina, or as he referred to as 'Nening,' to Tanawan to celebrate the town festival. However, the joy and excitement felt by the siblings disappeared as their mother could not be with them. As Rizal missed his mother dearly, he went to visit her without advising neither his mother nor his father about it; he thought his mother would be delighted if she knew how well he did in class, but they only wept when they saw each other as it had been more than a year since they had been together.</p>
		<p>Time flew fast, and Rizal had to return to Manila as his vacation had ended; he registered in his second year and sought a place to stay in Walled City because living so far away was tiresome. Rizal found a home at 6 Calle Magallanes, where an old widow, Doña Pepay, lives with her widowed daughter, Doña Encarnación, and her sons, José, Rafael, Ignacio, and Ramón. Rizal revisited his mother once more, and similar to Joseph, he foretold from a dream about his mother's release from prison in three months, which did come true. During this period, Rizal developed an interest in reading novels, devoting his leisure time to it, and even persuaded his father to buy him a Cesar Cantu y Diós' history collection, which helped him learn a great deal merely by reading them. To much of his surprise, despite falling behind his Spanish, Rizal still managed to win prizes during his quarterly examinations; if he hadn't made mistakes and spoke fluently in Spanish, he thought he might have been able to win a medal. By the time Rizal came back to Manila for his final year after vacation, the house of his former landlady was already fully occupied, so he had no other choice than to share a room with Paciano, his older brother; as he was under close supervision by his brother, Rizal could not act freely compared to as how he was in the past.</p>
		<p>It wasn't long until his mother was finally acquitted as she was proven innocent. Rizal's mother rushed to embrace him upon her release from prison. At the end of his vacation, Rizal once more set out to search for a new place to stay as he didn't want to share a place with his brother, seeing as he couldn't do what he wanted due to the close supervision; he finally found one located in Calle Solana be in the ownership of a priest. His mother no longer wanted him to return to Manila for the reason that his education was already adequate. Moreover, his future career was still undecided, but he enrolled in that course due to his father's request to take metaphysics. Nevertheless, as he was uninterested in the course chosen by his father, Rizal refused to purchase a copy of the textbook. As Rizal distrusted friendship at a very young age due to what happened to his mother, his only intimate friend was his previous schoolmate who had graduated from college three months prior; he resided in the street similar to Rizal's wherein his companions in the resident recently arrived in Manila and have initially been from Batangas.  </p>
		<p>Seeing as his friend's great-aunt knew Rizal's father, he was usually requested to come over to Trozo, where his great-aunt lives during Sundays and holidays. During one of his visits, he met Segunda Katigbak, the sister of his friend whom he had declared to have fallen in love with at first sight. Because of this, Rizal frequently visited his sister when she entered college in La Concordia because Katigbak also studied in the same school as his sister's. Unfortunately, the two were not destined for each other as Katigbak was engaged to Don Manuel Luz, a young man from a prominent family in Batangas. Rizal even went to La Concordia on December 8 to celebrate its festival with other students. Soon after the celebration, Rizal went home to spend his Christmas holidays with his family. He met a girl similar to his hometown on the steamer he rode, who was once a Santa Catalina College student for over two decades. The girl was rather bashful since she traveled with her father, so she kept her back on him while they conversed. Considering that it was quite a long trip, Rizal tried to maintain a conversation with her by asking her about her university and academics, but he received little more than "yes" and "no" responses. Rizal thought that the Kalamba girl seemed to have almost forgotten her Tagalog completely. As Teodora, Rizal's mother, nearly lost her sight, she did not recognize him at once when he walked into their home in Kalamba.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, his sisters greeted and welcomed him warmly and joyfully, while his father said the least despite seeming the one who was pleased the most with his return. Despite excelling in philosophy, Rizal decided to enroll in the University of Santo Tomas' Faculty of Medical Sciences and specialize in ophthalmology due to his mother's impending blindness. During his second year, he met Leonor Valenzuela, in which he refers to as 'Orang,' a woman six years younger than him and the daughter of the owner of the boarding house he was currently residing in (Limos, 2018). Rizal eventually courted Valenzuela and started exchanging letters written using invisible ink created from table salt and water; to read the letters, Valenzuela would heat the letters beneath a light or lamp to allow the words to show. During Rizal's third year in the university, he met Leonor Rivera, a woman studying at La Concordia College, which his sister attends. In the same year, Rizal and Rivera got engaged; they exchanged letters, and Rivera would use the pen name 'Taimis' as they kept their relationship a secret from her family. In 1882, Rizal left the medical program as the Dominican professors cited discrimination against the Filipino students.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, instead of being discouraged by the discrimination shown to Rizal and his fellow Filipinos, he used it as his motivation to strive harder in order to prove not only himself, but those who disfavored and looked down on him. Rizal believed that education in the Philippines was limited and decided to board a ship to Spain, with his older brother, Paciano, backing him but keeping their parents in the dark. He continued his studies in Spain, enrolling at the Unibersidad Central de Madrid, where he finished with a degree in medicine in 1884. In the following year, Rizal graduated from the same college with a degree in Philosophy and Letters. Despite having earned two degrees, Rizal remained dissatisfied with his education and opted to travel to France to study at the University of Paris; he also enrolled at the University of Heidelberg to increase his knowledge in ophthalmology under Professor Otto Becker, a distinguished eye specialist. During his stay in Europe, Rizal tasked his wingman Jose M. Cecilio to spy on Leonor Rivera and Leonor Valenzuela. Cecilio discovered that another man wanted to propose to Rivera, but since she was already engaged to Rizal, he tried to introduce him to Valenzuela instead; it was only then that he knew that Valenzuela was also engaged to Rizal at the same time he of his engagement with Rivera.</p>
		<p>On his first visit to Europe, he penned his infamous novel 'Noli Me Tangere,' initially written in Spanish and first produced in Berlin, Germany, around 1887. The novel narrates the narrative of a young Filipino guy who journeyed to Europe to improve his education, and upon his return to his motherland, his eyes became open to the country's injustices and corruption. The story employed a variety of characters representing the diverse personalities and qualities of both the oppressed and the oppressors, with a focus on Filipinos who had embraced the practices of the Spaniards to the point that they had lost their sense of identity, along with the Spanish friars portrayed to be greedy and lustful who only did nothing but satisfy their own needs. As the novel was about criticizing Spanish colonization in the Philippines and the country's society in general, there were several adverse reactions from the elites, church, and government. As Maria Clara, the female love interest of the protagonist, was the likes of Rivera, her mother bribed the local postman to intercept all correspondence between her daughter and Rizal. In addition, Rivera's father told Rizal to stay away from their family to keep them safe (Limos, 2018). Three years later, Rizal found out that Rivera married Kipping as told by her mother and devastated him that he flew to Europe around 1890 and explored numerous places such as Madrid and Paris to pursue his career. </p>
		<p>Despite the outcome and consequences of 'Noli Me Tangere,' Rizal still desired to educate and enlighten the Filipinos regarding the evils of the Spaniards towards his countrymen; and so, in 1891, he courageously published his second novel, ‘El Filibusterismo.’ The novel's protagonist was a pacifist and advocate of peaceful means of reforms to enact the necessary change in the system. The government noticed that the second novel was a catalyst to encourage the Filipinos to revolt against the Spanish colonizers and overthrow the colonial government. In December 1891, he relocated to Hong Kong with his family and opened a clinic on D'Aguilar Street in the Central District. In Hong Kong, he first encountered Marie Josephine Leopoldine Bracken. Rizal described Bracken as having stunning blue eyes, brown hair, and a cheerful demeanor. She and her adoptive father, George Taufer, went to Rizal's clinic to test her father's declining eyesight. </p>
		<p>When Rizal returned to the Philippines, he founded La Liga Filipina, which the government quickly abolished, deeming it a treasonous group. Andres Bonifacio, one of several leaders of the resistance movement known as Katipunan, read Rizal's novels and utilized them as a foundation for revolution; without his permission, the Katipuneros identified Rizal as a member owing to his inspirations, even yelling his name as part of their war cry. Because of being subversive and the reported involvement in the rebellion, the Spanish government arrested Rizal and deported him to Dapitan in Mindanao in July of the same year. Rizal had the choice to stay in the parish convent of Dapitan if he retracted his 'religious errors' and confessed about his past life. However, because he was unwilling to accept the Jesuits' terms, Rizal chose to live at Casa Real, a commandant's mansion. Captain Ricardo Carnicero, the commandant, and Rizal became such close friends that it appeared as though the captain was not his guard at all. Rizal addressed a poem entitled 'A Don Ricardo Carnicero' to the captain, as mentioned earlier on his birthday on August 26, 1892, to appreciate his compassion.</p>
		<p>The Manila Loretty ticket with the number 9736, held by Rizal, Carnicero, and a Spanish citizen from Dipolog, came in second with a prize of twenty-thousand pesos in September 1892. Rizal utilized a portion of his share of six thousand two hundred pesos to purchase a plot of land along the shore of Talisay, a barrio near Dapitan; three houses made of bamboo, wood, and put up nipa on a property of more than ten hectares. A square-shaped house was where Rizal lived, and the hexagon-shaped house was what he used as a barn where he kept his chickens. In the third house, the octagon-shaped one, Rizal used it as a place to stay for his pupils. Rizal not only put up houses but also a school that teaches young boys pragmatic subjects such as reading, writing, geography, mathematics, and English and Spanish. Sometime after, Rizal constructed other huts to aid out-of-town recovering patients.</p>
		<p>Rizal's exile didn't seem like an exile as he could still do things he desired, such as practicing medicine, teaching students, and even taking pleasure in farming and horticulture. Moreover, he planted trees, along with taking care of animals. The school founded by Rizal in 1893 initially started with three pupils and reached a number higher than twenty at the end of his exile. He had a routine of waking up at five in the morning to check on and water his plants, feed the animals, and prepare breakfast. After fueling his day with breakfast, he attends to the patients visiting his home. Subsequently, he spends his whole morning attending to his other patients in Dapitan. At noon, Rizal would return to Talisay to eat his lunch and would kill time until two o'clock as it is time to teach his other students, which usually ends between four or five in the afternoon. Rizal would often spend the rest of his day planting trees and watering plants with the help of his students, and during nightfall, he would often read and write.</p>
		<p>The Jesuits persevered in persuading Rizal to return to the Catholic fold by providing him a room at the Dapitan monastery under certain conditions. Since Rizal refused to compromise and refused to live with Antonio Obach, the parish priest of the church's convent, the church chose to assign Francisco de Paula Sanchez as the parish priest of Dapitan barely a month after Rizal's deportation, as he was Rizal's favorite schoolmaster at Ateneo. Rizal and Father Sanchez had numerous cortical religious talks, but Rizal was not persuaded to change his views despite respecting the parish priest's efforts. However, despite the differences in beliefs, the two still maintained a great friendship and did not let their differences get in the way. Even Pablo Pastells, the priest superior of the Jesuit Society in the Philippines, attempted to win Rizal to Catholicism. Rizal exchanged letters with the said priest four times which started from September of 1892 until April the following year. Their letters contained none other than debates that manifested the knowledge of Rizal in the Holy Scriptures. Moreover, despite Rizal's consistent attendance of masses in Dapitan, he still refused to espouse the conventional type of Catholicism.</p>
		<p>Even while in exile, Rizal accomplished several things, including delivering good community services in Dapitan, such as using discarded bottles and bamboo joints to improve the town's drainage. Being associated with medicine and health, he also taught the town's people about the need for health and cleanliness in preventing the spread of infection. Rizal and a Jesuit priest, a dear friend of his, Father Sanchez, also made a relief map in the plaza of Dapitan. Rizal improved the forest by creating clear routes, staircases, and a few benches; he also built the wooden machine that helped mass-produce bricks, which he utilized to build a water dam for the community with the aid of his pupils. As a town doctor, Rizal treated all of his patients equally, regardless of their income or social background. Rizal received chickens and crops as payment for his services, and for those who couldn't pay or provide anything in exchange, he provided them for free.</p>
		<p>Rizal's image as a competent ophthalmologist was well recognized even outside the Philippines. Mr. George Taufer, Josephine Bracken's adoptive father, was advised to arrange an appointment with Dr. Jose Rizal in Dapitan to address his failing vision. Bracken, Taufer, and a certain Manuela Orlac claiming to be a friar's mistress took out for Dapitan in late February 1895. Despite his specialty in ophthalmology, he also treats a variety of ailments such as fever, sprain, fractured bones, etc. Rizal helped abaca farmers by exchanging harvests from Dapitan to Manila and teaching them how to weave hammocks out of abaca.</p>
		<p>Similarly, Rizal also taught the fishers better techniques to improve themselves as their fishing methods were inefficient. By being a scientist and philologist, Rizal also inspected the flora and fauna of Dapitan apart from carrying out archeological excavations. He provided some taxonomy to several land and sea species and sent several biological specimens to his dear friend in Dresden, Dr. Adolph B. Meyer, from his laboratory and herbarium. The European scholars, in return, would send him books and other academic reading materials, and even named at least three specimens sent by Rizal after him; (1) 'Rhacophorus rizali,' a frog from Dapitan; (2) 'Apogonia rizali,' some beetle; and (3) 'Draco rizali,' a flying dragon. When Rizal learned about the language in the Visayas, he engaged himself in studying its language and its culture and literature. In line with this, he also looked into the local folklore, customs, Tagalog grammar, and the Malays' language. All of the things he learned resulted in him relating some to the European academicians, such as his close philologist friend in London, Doctor Reinhold Rost.</p>
		<p>Rizal was captivated by Josephine's charm and courted her despite not being a woman of exceptional beauty. While living with Rizal, Josephine learned several household chores to help Rizal and care for him. Eventually, Josephine became pregnant. She was shocked and fell on an iron stand as Rizal played a prank on her. Rizal was distraught by the preterm birth that occurred due to the tragedy. In honor of his father, he named the stillborn infant Francisco and buried him. In 1895, Blumentritt notified Rizal of a yellow fever outbreak raging in rebellion Cuba, another Spanish colony. Due to the shortage of physicians that would attend to the victims of war along with those people deeply affected by the disease, Rizal wrote to Ramon Blanco, the then governor-general stating that he wanted to volunteer in Cuba to provide medical services to those in need. Months have passed, and no reply was received, so Rizal was no longer interested in what he had requested. Nevertheless, on July 30 of the following year, the governor-general finally sent a letter sanctioning his request.</p>
		<p>Rizal made immediate preparations to leave for Cuba as fast as possible; he sold and gave his properties as a souvenir to his students. Rizal left with Josephine, his sister Narcisa, his niece and nephews, and his three students in the late afternoon of the next day. Several people from Dapitan went to bid farewell to Rizal, especially his students; when they bid him farewell, they shouted "Adios, Dr. Rizal!" as several of his students sobbed. Rizal waved his hand in farewell to all the people of Dapitan who had shown him nothing but compassion as he shouted back the words "Adios, Dapitan!" Rizal goes on to write while onboard, "I have been in that district for four years, thirteen days, and a few hours," with tears in his eyes. While going to Cuba, he was arrested and charged with conspiracy and sedition. On December 27, 1896, Rizal was sentenced to death by the Spanish court.</p>
		<p>Rizal's scheduled on December 30 the year 1896. He was permitted to marry Bracken two hours before his execution at approximately five o'clock, and he was also able to slip out the farewell poem, 'Mi Ultimo Adios,' for his family before his execution. On the calm and clear morning, tied from elbow to elbow, Rizal strolled to Bagumbayan, or presently known as Rizal Park or Luneta Park for some. Rizal wore black coat and trousers with a white shirt and waistcoat underneath it, along with a bowler hat on his head. Notwithstanding his death, passersby recounted Rizal as serene as he looked a bit pale not because he feared his fate, but for the reason of not eating anything for breakfast; instead of eating the three hard-boiled eggs given to him, he took it to the corner of his prison cell before leaving and muttered that the eggs are for the rats and they should have a fiesta as well. A soldier signaled his passage with a bugle, and the toned-down drums in black cloth gave rhythm to his manner of walking. After leaving Fort Santiago, he strolled down the Paseo Maria Cristina, presently known as Bonifacio Drive. On his right was the Manila bay that gave him a view lifting the darkness, and on his left was his last glimpse of Intramuros.</p>
		<p>On both sides of Rizal were two men whom the young Rizal and his schoolmates in Ateneo referred to as 'paniki' or bats as they always had their black hats that had been a trademark, along with the tunics and heavy coats. The men were Jesuit priests, Father Estanislao March and Father Jose Villaclara. Lieutenant Luis Taviel de Andrade, the brother of Rizal's former bodyguard who had defended him in a farce masquerading as a trial, walked behind him. People filled the streets as they wanted to glimpse the condemned man as he was known for many things to different people—leader of the revolution, poet, novelist, physician, subversive, heretic, sculptor. Moreover, some stated that Rizal nodded from left to right, acknowledging the faces familiar to him in the crowd and smiling from time to time, and laughing at the few jokes he made about the priests on both sides. Some also stated that they had noticed Rizal's eyes darting quickly from left to right, as some also believed that the Katipuneros or his family members would attempt to save him from his death.</p>
		<p>When they arrived in Bagumbayan, given the characteristic of a cube, three or four individuals lined up on three sides and the fourth towards the bay and the executioners' line of fire. The firing squad consisted of eight Filipino soldiers armed with Remingtons, and behind them were the Spanish soldiers together with Mausers who would shoot the Filipinos if they refused to execute Rizal or purposely miss the target. There was a slight delay in the execution as Rizal had a few requests, such as refusing to be blindfolded and turning his back on the firing squad; however, the Spanish captain refused his request and insisted he turn his back as he was a traitor to Spain. Rizal argued that he never once betrayed Spain or his country, and after some coaxing, Rizal finally turned his back, still refusing to be blindfolded and kneel. A few moments before his execution, Rizal made one more request: strike him in the back, near the heart, and spare his head. Upon the captain's approval of his request, he took Lieutenant Taviel de Andrade's hand in his and took the opportunity to thank him one final time for the hopeless attempt to defend him before the court-martial that condemned him to death.</p>
		<p>Simultaneously, a curious Spanish military doctor was surprised to find Rizal's pulse normal despite being near his death. The Jesuits were the last to leave Rizal and raised a crucifix to his face; Rizal, on the other hand, turned away and prepared for his death silently. The captain ordered his soldiers to "Preparen!" as he hoisted his sword in the air, followed by "Apunten!" as a command to point their firearms towards Rizal. Before setting the sword down and shouting "Fuego!" to fire, Rizal exclaimed, "Consummatum est!" which translates to "it is done." They fired shots, and the bullets hit Rizal, and a few moments before falling, he executed what he had been practicing for a long time to ensure that he would face up upon his death. As the soldiers walked up to Rizal, the people held their breath, and the soldiers shot him in the head to ensure he was dead. The silence broke out when someone shouted, "Long live Spain! Death to the traitor!" There was no response from the crowd; instead, an officer approached the individual and berated him.</p>
		<p><a name="bottom"></a>Rizal Day is observed on December 30th to commemorate Jose Rizal's great accomplishment. Rizal provided the Filipinos an eye-opener with his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, exposing the cruelty and injustice of the Spaniards to his countrymen despite knowing that he would be put in danger doing so. Instead of being frightened, Rizal proceeded because he knew how vital it was for Filipinos to be aware of the truth of the situation and put an end to the colonizers' deception. Furthermore, Rizal's selection as the Philippines' national hero was prompted not only by the intention to unmask the Spaniards but also by the fact that he was a role model worthy of young admiration. Despite prejudice and being looked down upon by various people, Rizal used it as motivation to work harder and prove something to himself and those who looked down on him. He believed that his education in the Philippines was inadequate, so he traveled to Europe to further his studies, which significantly helped him. Rizal had many challenges during his life, yet he never saw them as obstacles but rather as opportunities for growth.</p>
